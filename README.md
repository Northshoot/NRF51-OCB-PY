# NRF51-OCB-PY
A port of OCB implementation for NRF51 using softdevice.
the test.py allows to receive data from uart and decrypt it.
Same py implementation can be used in the cloud, go figure.

Note: there is a Python OCB implementation, however, it supports version 2.
This application supports version 3, hence the usage of the referece code. 

This applicaiton is not suitable for production, not code optimization have been done.

## Usage
Compile shared C library
gcc -o ocb_encrypt_lib.so -shared -fPIC -lcrypto  ocb_shared_lib.c

Compile and upload nrf application
make && nrfjprog program -s /PATH_TO_SDK/s110_nrf51822_7.1.0/s110_nrf51822_7.1.0_softdevice.hex -c _build/nrf51422_xxac.hex
